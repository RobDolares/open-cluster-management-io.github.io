## What is `ManifestWork`

`ManifestWork` is to define a group of Kubernetes resource on the hub to be applied to the managed cluster. In the open-cluster-management project, a `ManifestWork` resource must be created in the cluster namespace. A work agent implemented in [work](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/work) project is run on the managed cluster and monitors the `ManifestWork` resource in the cluster namespace on the hub cluster.

An example of `ManifestWork` to deploy a deployment to the managed cluster is shown in the following example.

```yaml
apiVersion: work.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManifestWork
metadata:
  name: hello-work
  namespace: cluster1
  labels:
    app: hello
spec:
  workload:
    manifests:
      - apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: hello
          namespace: default
        spec:
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: hello
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: hello
            spec:
              containers:
                - name: hello
                  image: quay.io/asmacdo/busybox
                  command:
                    ["sh", "-c", 'echo "Hello, Kubernetes!" && sleep 3600']
```

## Status tracking

Work agent will track all the resources defined in `ManifestWork` and update the its status. There are two types of status in manifestwork. The `resourceStatus` tracks the status of each manifest in the `ManifestWork` and `conditions` reflects the overall status of the `ManifestWork`. Work agent currently checks whether a resource is `Available`, meaning the resource exists on the managed cluster, and `Applied` means the resource defined in `ManifestWork` has been applied to the managed cluster.

Here is an example.

```yaml
apiVersion: work.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManifestWork
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hello
  name: hello-work
  namespace: cluster1
spec: ... ...
status:
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2021-06-15T02:26:02Z"
      message: Apply manifest work complete
      reason: AppliedManifestWorkComplete
      status: "True"
      type: Applied
    - lastTransitionTime: "2021-06-15T02:26:02Z"
      message: All resources are available
      reason: ResourcesAvailable
      status: "True"
      type: Available
  resourceStatus:
    manifests:
      - conditions:
          - lastTransitionTime: "2021-06-15T02:26:02Z"
            message: Apply manifest complete
            reason: AppliedManifestComplete
            status: "True"
            type: Applied
          - lastTransitionTime: "2021-06-15T02:26:02Z"
            message: Resource is available
            reason: ResourceAvailable
            status: "True"
            type: Available
        resourceMeta:
          group: apps
          kind: Deployment
          name: hello
          namespace: default
          ordinal: 0
          resource: deployments
          version: v1
```

## Garbage collection

To ensure the resources applied by `ManifestWork` are reliably recorded, the work agent creates an `AppliedManifestWork` on the managed cluster for each `ManifestWork` as an anchor for resources relating to `ManifestWork`. When `ManifestWork` is deleted, work agent runs a `Foreground deletion`, that `ManifestWork` will stay in deleting state until all its related resources has been fully cleaned in the managed cluster.
