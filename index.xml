      <description>May 24, 2021 April 22, 2021     May 24, 2021    Michael Elder put together a user walk through for the basic Open Cluster Management API using kind, olm, and other open source technologies. See https://github.com/mdelder/open-cluster-management-getting-started for more details.
April 22, 2021    Inspired by the famous article Kubernetes The Hard Way, Dario Minonne created a tutorial for setting up Open Cluster Management the hard way.</description>

      <description>This page tells you the architecture and basic concepts in open-cluster-management.
   Overview Hub cluster Klusterlet Managed cluster Application lifecycle Governance and risk     Overview    open-cluster-management enables any capability within the Kubernetes ecosystem to orchestrate itself across multiple clusters and cloud providers. Consider the requirements that a capability within the Kubernetes ecosystem would need to become multicluster-aware.
 The service must have an API to determine the inventory of available clusters.</description>

      <description>The are two ways to install the core control plane of open cluster management that includes cluster registration and manifests distribution.
   Prerequisite Install from source Install community operator from OperatorHub.io     Prerequisite    Ensure kubectl and kustomize are installed.
Ensure golang is installed, if you are planning to install from the source.
Prepare one Kubernetes cluster to function as the hub. For example, use kind to create a hub cluster.</description>

      <description>After the cluster manager is installed on the hub cluster, you need to install the klusterlet agent on another cluster so that it can be registered and managed by the hub cluster.
   Prerequisite Install from source Install community operator from OperatorHub.io What is next Troubleshooting     Prerequisite    Ensure kubectl and kustomize are installed.
Ensure golang is installed, if you are planning to install from the source.</description>

      <description>ManagedCluster Registration    ManagedCluster is a cluster scoped API on the hub cluster to define a Kubernetes cluster registered with the hub cluster. In open-cluster-management, the cluster registration follows a double opt-in mechanism which is:
 An agent opts in to register a cluster with the hub by creating a ManagedCluster resource on the hub. The agent needs a kubeconfig with appropriate permission (bootstrap kubeconfig) to initiate the registration request An admin user on the hub opts in to explicitly accept the registration of the ManagedCluster.</description>

      <guid>http://open-cluster-management.io/concepts/manifestwork/</guid>
      <description>What is ManifestWork    ManifestWork is to define a group of Kubernetes resource on the hub to be applied to the managed cluster. In the open-cluster-management project, a ManifestWork resource must be created in the cluster namespace. A work agent implemented in work project is run on the managed cluster and monitors the ManifestWork resource in the cluster namespace on the hub cluster.
An example of ManifestWork to deploy a deployment to the managed cluster is shown in the following example.</description>

      <description>Placement API is used to select a set of managed clusters in one or multiple ManagedClusterSets so that the user&amp;rsquo;s workloads can be deployed to these clusters.
Bind ManagedClusterSet to a namespace    Before creating a Placement, you need to create a ManagedClusterSetBinding in a namespace to bind to a ManagedClusterSet. Then you can create a Placement in the same namespace to select the clusters in this ManagedClusterSet. Assume a ManagedClusterSet is created on the hub cluster as seen in the following examples.</description>

      <description>What is an add-on?    Open-cluster-management has a mechanism to help developers to develop an extension based on the foundation components for the purpose of working with multiple clusters in various asepcts. Examples of add-ons includes:
 A tool to collect alert events in the managed cluster, and send to the hub cluster. A network solution that uses the hub to share the network info and establish connection among managed clusters.</description>
